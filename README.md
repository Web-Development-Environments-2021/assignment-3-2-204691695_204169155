# Introduction
<br>
<p>
For the server side, we developed an API and worked with the site <a href="https://www.sportmonks.com/soccer-api/">sportsmonks</a> to get information about football games,players etc .,
We also used azure cloud SQL for our DB and worked with Swagger UI for conveninet API integration.
